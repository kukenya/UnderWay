The prefabs of the storm lighter have an attached script-componente (StormLighter.cs) where you can select a key for open/close and a key for turning on the lighter.

It also contains an animator-componente with the corresponding state-machine (StormLighterController) for the animation of the different states.

The audio files are in Resources/Sounds. If you want to use your own sound-files put them there and name them "Clap_Close", "Clap_Open" and "Fire_On" or you set a new path in the script.

Feel free to change it for your purpose :)
